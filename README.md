# Galvanize-DSI-Capstone-Project-2

## Proposal 1
### Fashion-MNIST

Fashion-MNIST consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. It is a replacement for the overused MNIST database, which is great for data scientists to practive with and improve their skillset. Each image is in greyscale and associated with a label from 10 classes. I intend to use this dataset to try out image processing and CNN image classification.
