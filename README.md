# Galvanize-DSI-Capstone-Project-2

## Proposal 1
### Fashion-MNIST

Fashion-MNIST consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. It is a replacement for the overused MNIST database, which is great for data scientists to practive with and improve their skillset. Each image is in greyscale and associated with a label from 10 classes. I intend to use this dataset to try out image processing and CNN image classification.

## Proposal 2
### Breast Histopathology Images Dataset

This dataset contains 2,77,524 images of size 50Ã—50 extracted from 162 mount slide images of breast cancer specimens scanned at 40x. There are 1,98,738 negative tests and 78,786 positive tests with IDC.

I will try to build a Convolutional neural networks model that can classify breast cancer.

## Proposal 3
### IMDB Reviews

This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification. It's a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training, and 25,000 for testing. I will try to employ Text Classification and Naive Bayes on this one.
